# Ekagra – Your Focus, Your Rules  

---

## The Problem I Faced  

I love learning from videos, but I often found myself getting distracted. Sometimes, I'd switch tabs to check something quickly, and when I came back, I had already missed an important part. Other times, I'd scroll down to read comments, only to realize the video kept playing in the background.  

It was frustrating. Rewinding and catching up again broke my flow. I needed a way to make sure I could focus on content when I was actually watching it—and pause it when I wasn’t.

## What is Ekagra?  

Ekagra is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance focus. It automatically pauses videos when you switch tabs or scroll down and resumes them when you return. You can also whitelist websites where you don’t want this feature to apply.

## What Problem Does It Solve?  

Ekagra is built for people who want to stay engaged with their videos without missing anything. Whether you’re watching a lecture, a tutorial, or even a documentary, this extension ensures that the content only plays when you are actively watching. No more rewinding. No more distractions. Just seamless learning and focus.

- **Pause on Tab Switch** – Automatically pauses videos when you leave the tab.  
- **Resume on Tab Focus** – Resumes playback as soon as you come back.

## How These Features Help  

These features work together to eliminate distractions and make video learning more effective. If you need to take notes or check something in another tab, you won’t have to rewind later. If you’re scrolling through comments or reading something else, the video will wait for you. And if you have websites where you don’t want this behavior, you have full control over that too.

## How to Use Ekagra  

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.  
2. Open a video on YouTube or any supported site.  
3. Switch to another tab or scroll down—the video will pause automatically.  
4. Return to the tab or scroll back up—the video will resume.  
5. To exclude a website from these features, add it to the whitelist.  

That’s it! Simple, effective, and designed for focus.
