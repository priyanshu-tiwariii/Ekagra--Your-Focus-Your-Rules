# Ekagra - Your Focus, Your Rules  


## The Problem I Faced  

I love learning from videos, but I often found myself getting distracted. Sometimes, I'd switch tabs to check something quickly, and when I came back, I had already missed an important part. Other times, I'd scroll down to read comments, only to realize the video kept playing in the background.  

It was frustrating. Rewinding and catching up again broke my flow. I needed a way to make sure I could focus on content when I was actually watching it and pause it when I wasn‚Äôt.

## What is Ekagra?  


**Ekagra** is a minimal yet intelligent **Chrome extension** designed to help you stay focused on your video learning.  
It **automatically pauses** the video when:

- You switch tabs  
- You scroll away from the video  

And **resumes playback** the moment you return to the tab or scroll back.  
You‚Äôre also in control add any website to the **whitelist** to disable these features as needed.

> "Ekagra" (‡§è‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞) is a Sanskrit word meaning *one-pointed focus*, which perfectly defines the vision of this tool.
